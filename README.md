# Tech-To-Protect-Challenge-2019-CODEATHON
SafeCam mobile app, created for the Tech To Project Challenge in San Francisco 2019 - Awarded as Top submission for Contest #9

The goal of the app is to provide a secure way for first responders and police officers to take photos, as well as a system for validating that an image has not been tampered with. It uses cryptographic hash codes to ensure the integrity of photos taken with the app and a cloud data store to record the hash codes in real time.

Steps to make it work:

Install cocoapods: 'gem install cocoapods'

Install dependecies: 'pod install'

Open the project with XCode
